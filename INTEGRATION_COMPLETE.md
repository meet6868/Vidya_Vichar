# Backend Integration Complete! 🎉

## What We've Accomplished

### ✅ Database Setup
- **Test Data Created**: Successfully seeded MongoDB with realistic test data
- **Fixed Schema Issues**: Corrected unique constraints in models
- **3 Courses**: CS101, DS202, WEB301 with proper enrollment data
- **5 Lectures**: With topics, dates, and student attendance
- **4 Resources**: Text and PDF resources linked to lectures  
- **5 Questions**: With answers and resource references

### ✅ Backend API Endpoints Added
- `GET /users/student/dashboard/course-lectures/:courseId` - Get lectures for a course
- `GET /users/student/dashboard/lecture-doubts/:lectureId` - Get doubts for a lecture
- Updated existing endpoints to work with real data

### ✅ Frontend Integration
- **AttendedCourses**: Now fetches real enrolled courses from backend
- **CourseLectures**: Gets actual lecture data with topics and dates
- **LectureDoubts**: Displays real questions, answers, and resources
- **API Configuration**: Updated to use backend endpoints

### ✅ Models Fixed
- **Lecture.js**: Removed incorrect unique constraints
- **Question.js**: Fixed array unique constraints  
- **Course.js**: Aligned with proper schema requirements

## 🧪 Test Data Overview

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:5000
2. **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3001

### Test Flow:
1. Login as a student (use existing student credentials)
2. Navigate to "Attended Courses" 
3. Click on any course to see lectures
4. Click "View Doubts" on any lecture to see questions/answers
5. Check that resources are displayed with questions

### API Endpoints You Can Test:
```bash
# Get enrolled courses
GET http://localhost:5000/api/users/student/dashboard/enrolled-courses

# Get lectures for CS101
GET http://localhost:5000/api/users/student/dashboard/course-lectures/CS101

# Get doubts for a lecture  
GET http://localhost:5000/api/users/student/dashboard/lecture-doubts/LEC_CS101_001
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Test the Frontend**: Navigate through Attended Courses → Lectures → Doubts
2. **Verify Data Display**: Check that topics, dates, questions, and answers show correctly
3. **Resource Integration**: Confirm resources are displayed with questions
4. **Error Handling**: Test with different course/lecture IDs

## 📝 Notes

- **Topics**: Currently using database topics (no teacher API call needed yet)
- **Student Names**: Using mock names in doubt cards (can be replaced with real student data later)
- **Authentication**: Make sure to login with proper student credentials to access the data
- **Database**: MongoDB is populated with consistent test data for realistic testing

**Your attended courses flow is now fully integrated with the backend! 🎯**
