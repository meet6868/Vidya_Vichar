# Authentication System Fix Summary

## Problem
The create course functionality was failing with "Teacher not found" error because the system was using mock tokens instead of proper JWT authentication.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Mock Token Bypass**: The backend had a development bypass that used hardcoded mock user data instead of validating real JWT tokens
2. **Frontend Mock Logic**: The frontend was automatically setting mock tokens and mock user data in development mode
3. **Duplicate Controller Functions**: There were two `createCourse` functions in the teacher controller, causing confusion
4. **Authentication Flow Issues**: The system was not properly validating real user sessions

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **auth.controller.js**:
   - Removed mock token bypass logic from the `authenticate` middleware
   - Now properly validates JWT tokens using `jwt.verify()`
   - Returns proper error responses with `success: false` format
   - Added better error handling for expired tokens

2. **teacher.controller.js**:
   - Removed the duplicate/first `createCourse` function (lines 296-355)
   - Kept only the second, more complete `createCourse` function that properly handles `additional_teachers` and `tas` parameters
   - This function correctly expects the parameters sent by the frontend

### Frontend Changes

1. **config/api.js**:
   - Removed mock token auto-generation logic from `getAuthHeaders()`
   - Simplified authentication to only use tokens from localStorage
   - Removed debug logging that was cluttering the console
   - Now properly fails if no token is available instead of creating fake ones

2. **pages/teacher/TeacherDashboard.jsx**:
   - Removed mock data injection during component initialization
   - Removed the `handleDebugToken()` function that was setting fake tokens
   - Removed auth bypass logic that was setting mock user data
   - Now relies on real authentication flow

3. **pages/student/StudentDashboard.jsx**:
   - Removed mock token and mock user data logic
   - Cleaned up authentication checks to use real tokens only

## How Authentication Works Now

1. **Login Process**:
   - User logs in via `/auth/teacher/login` or `/auth/student/login`
   - Server validates credentials and returns a real JWT token
   - Frontend stores the token in localStorage
   - Token contains real user ID and role information

2. **API Requests**:
   - All protected API calls include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
   - Backend validates the token using JWT secret
   - If token is valid, `req.user` contains the decoded user information
   - If token is invalid/expired, returns 401 Unauthorized

3. **Create Course Flow**:
   - Teacher must be logged in with valid JWT token
   - Token contains real teacher's MongoDB ObjectId as `req.user.id`
   - Controller looks up teacher in database using this ID
   - If teacher exists, course creation proceeds
   - If teacher not found, returns proper error

## Testing the Fix

To test the create course functionality:

1. **Ensure Teacher Exists in Database**:
   - The JWT token's user ID must correspond to a real teacher record in MongoDB
   - Teacher must have been properly registered via the registration endpoint

2. **Proper Login Flow**:
   - Use the teacher login form to get a real JWT token
   - Don't manually set tokens in localStorage
   - Verify token is stored after successful login

3. **Create Course Request**:
   - Frontend sends POST to `/api/users/teacher/course`
   - Must include valid Authorization header
   - Backend validates token and looks up teacher
   - If all valid, course is created successfully

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Database Synchronization**: Ensure the teacher ID in JWT matches actual teacher records
2. **Token Expiry**: JWT tokens expire after 1 day - users will need to re-login
3. **CORS Issues**: Ensure frontend and backend are properly configured for cross-origin requests
4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure JWT_SECRET is properly set in backend environment

The authentication system is now properly secure and doesn't rely on mock data or bypasses.
