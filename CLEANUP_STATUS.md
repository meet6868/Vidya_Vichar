# Frontend Mock Data Cleanup Summary

## Issues Found & Status

### ✅ COMPLETED:
1. **API Configuration (config/api.js)**
   - ✅ Removed mock token auto-generation
   - ✅ Updated teacher endpoints to match backend routes
   - ✅ Added proper API methods for all backend endpoints

2. **Authentication System**
   - ✅ Removed mock token bypass from backend middleware
   - ✅ Cleaned up frontend authentication flow
   - ✅ Removed debug functions and mock data injection

3. **Teacher Dashboard (TeacherDashboard.jsx)**
   - ✅ Removed mock data usage flags
   - ✅ Updated to use real API calls only
   - ✅ Removed fallback mock data for courses and lectures

### 🔄 PARTIALLY COMPLETED:
4. **Student Components**
   - ✅ EnrolledCourses.jsx - Removed bypass logic
   - ✅ StudentClasses.jsx - Updated to use API calls
   - ⚠️ Still need to clean up other student components

5. **Teacher Components**
   - ⚠️ AllDoubtsTeacher.jsx - Has syntax errors from incomplete cleanup
   - ❌ ClassPage.jsx - Still has mock data
   - ❌ Other teacher components need review

### ❌ PENDING:
6. **API Endpoint Verification**
   - Need to ensure all components use correct endpoints
   - Update components still using old API methods

7. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test all API flows end-to-end
   - Verify data is properly passed between components
   - Check error handling for failed API calls

## Next Steps:
1. Fix AllDoubtsTeacher.jsx syntax errors
2. Clean up remaining components with mock data
3. Update components to use new API methods
4. Test complete authentication and data flow
5. Verify all endpoints match backend routes exactly

## Components That Still Need Cleanup:
- `/pages/teacher/AllDoubtsTeacher.jsx` (syntax errors)
- `/pages/teacher/ClassPage.jsx` (mock data)
- `/pages/student/AvailableCourses.jsx` (mock data comments)
- `/pages/student/LectureDoubts.jsx` (mock success responses)

## API Endpoints Updated:
- Teacher endpoints now match backend routes exactly
- Removed inconsistent dashboard paths
- Added all CRUD operations for courses, lectures, questions, answers
